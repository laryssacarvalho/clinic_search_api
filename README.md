## About The Project

The project is a solution for this [coding challenge](https://gitlab.scratchpay.com/-/snippets/33). 

The application consists of an API with only one endpoint to search clinics using different query params. 

The endpoint URL is **/clinics** and it is a GET method that allow any of the following query params:

- name
- state (name or abbreviation)
- from
- to

You can combine the parameters to filter the list as you like.

For example, calling the endpoint passing the name filter (/clinics?name=good) will return the following response body:
```
[
   {
      "name":"Good Health Home",
      "stateName":"Alaska",
      "availability":{
         "from":"10:00",
         "to":"19:30"
      }
   },
   {
      "name":"Good Health Home",
      "stateName":"Florida",
      "availability":{
         "from":"15:00",
         "to":"20:00"
      }
   }
]
```

## Built With

The project was built in [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en) using [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/pt-br/) framework with TypeScript.

## Getting Started
